Hello, and welcome to BergInsights.

BergInsights is an all-in-one Annenberg Dining web application for Harvard students. The site allows students to view the entrees of previous, current, and upcoming Annenberg meals with crowdsourced ratings and comments, see the current line wait time at Annenberg Hall, and order food from Berg directly to their dorm through a dining hall delivery platform

On the homepage, our site displays the names, ratings, and comments for each entree of the current or next scheduled Annenberg meal based on the date and time of day. Users can preview upcoming meals or review past meals by moving the homepage carousel to the left or right with the arrow buttons. Our homepage also displays the projected dining hall line wait time based on the time of day. This way, users will be able to decide if and when they want to eat their meals. 

The navigation bar of BergInsights includes links to a few pages: BergDash, About, Contact Us, and Form. The About and Contact Us pages include text information about our website and us. The Form button takes users to a page where they can submit information about their meal and dining hall experience. Users can submit a general wait time report for the time at which they were waiting in line at the dining hall, rate each entree item that they tried on a scale from 1-5, and if they so desire, submit comments for each entree as well. User data submitted through the form is saved and averaged hollistically for use in the entree rating, wait time, and comment displays on the home page.

The BergInsights navigation bar also contains a link to BergDash. BergDash is a food delivery platform for the fine food of Harvard's Annenberg Hall, letting first-year students get food delivered straight to their dorm, or make money delivering. Here’s a quick guide on how to use BergDash:

Our project is coded in the form of a flask web application. You can run the project by opening the directory called "final" in the "project" folder and executing flask run in terminal. To run this project in our own repository, we had to execute "pip install flask", "pip install flask_session", and "pip install cs50".
